Mantle-compatible templates.
(https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle)
===========================

Why?
--------------
I really like Mogenerator and Mantle, so i wanted to use best of both worlds without hassle.
So idea behind it, is to have SomeObject (aka NSManagedObject) and SomeObjectModel (aka MTLObject) and set up mapping between them.


How to use
----------

- build Mogenerator from source (at least for now. i’ve added snake_case stuff, and it is not in main repo).
- point to attached templates via ‘--template-path’


TODO
-----
???

Feel free to fork & contribute.
